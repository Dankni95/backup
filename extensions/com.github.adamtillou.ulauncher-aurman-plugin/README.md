# Arch Package Search for ULauncher
IMPORTANT: aurman is no longer maintained, so this plugin has been updated to use yay instead.

## Description
This extension enables searching for and installing packages for Arch Linux. Typing 'pkg (package name)' will show installation options. Selecting one of the options will copy the command to install it to the clipboard.
## Requirements
Yay must be installed to enable searching for packages from the AUR.
## Installation
Open ULauncher, and click the settings cog to open the settings menu. Navigate to the extensions tab, click add extension, and then paste the github link (below) into the field.
